# NU Map — notes for Claude

## Data pipeline: current vs legacy

Read this before touching anything under `.github/workflows/` or `scripts/` that
updates course data. Two workflows are legacy and easy to mistake for the live path.

| Workflow | Cadence | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `update-courses.yml` | Monthly (1st, 06:00 UTC) | **The main pipeline.** Full catalog scrape of all ~130 subjects — titles, descriptions, credits, prereqs/coreqs, **NUPath** — plus Banner availability, offering summary, and manual patches. Pushes directly to main. |
| `update-majors.yml` | Bimonthly (odd months) | Undergrad program requirements |
| `update-grad-majors.yml` | Bimonthly (odd months) | Graduate program requirements |
| `catalog-rotate.yml` | **LEGACY — manual only** | Superseded by the monthly full scrape above. Old design: one subject every 3 days via PR review; its schedule was disabled because GitHub Actions here cannot open PRs. Do not re-enable. |
| `update-nupath.yml` | **LEGACY — manual only** | Superseded: NUPath rides the monthly catalog scrape (`nuPath` is a diff field in `scrape-catalog.js`). Kept only as a manual cross-check against the Registrar's Tableau dashboard, the authoritative NUPath source. Do not schedule it. |

Facts that follow from this:

- NUPath designations, descriptions, and prereqs all refresh **monthly** — do not
  describe them as static, manual, or annually updated.
- The runtime file is `public/northeastern/catalog-courses.json` (browser app,
  Node MCP server, and Cloudflare worker all load it). `all-courses.json` is the
  scrape intermediate; `merge-nupath.js` backfills nuPath from it at build time.
- Data fixes must live in the scrape scripts (both undergrad and grad paths),
  never in one-off migrations — the next scheduled scrape overwrites anything else.

## Claude/MCP integration

- Node dev server: `mcp-server/` (port 27182). Production: `cloudflare/mcp-server/`
  (Durable Objects + OAuth), deployed with `npx wrangler deploy`, live at
  mcp.numap.app. Both compose the same shared adapters in `src/adapters/mcp/` —
  changes to action semantics or tool docs need a worker redeploy to reach prod.
- Hexagonal rules: UI imports ports only (`src/ports/`), adapters import core only.
  The Claude UI motif is orange `#fb923c`; previews are dashed-orange ghosts.

## Conventions

- Conventional commits (`type: description`), no Co-Authored-By trailers.
- Localization: every user-facing string exists in all 8 locales
  (`src/locales/`), hand-written translations. "CLAUDE" stays untranslated.
  Summer terms are "Summer A" / "Summer B", never "Summer 1/2".
